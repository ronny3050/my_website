# Biography

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering), Michigan State University working at the Pattern Recognition and Image Processing lab. My current research lies in applying biometrics in various scenarios, such as authenticating riders for autonomous vehicles. In the past year, I worked on evaluating face recognition performance over time.
